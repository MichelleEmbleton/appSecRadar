# appSecRadar
Sherif Mansour's idea and design of a colour-coded radar chart to keep track of technologies in use, whether they are being evaluated, adopted or phased out.
Built with SVG and JavaScript.
Contains 2 files at present - the main .shtml file containing the SVGs and the JS and a small CSS file - which may be best split into separate files if the project is going to grow?!
Initially, a test object array is hard-coded into the page, but will need to be able to import a csv, json or text file to be of any use.
I've also created a radar in photoshop - and png dots - if preferable to SVGs.
Tested in:   FireFox 54.0.1 (latest version) & the previous version
             Safari 10.1.1
             Chrome 59.0.3071.115 (latest version)
Not tested in IE yet.
Refresh browser window to re-align dots - until a non-overlapping system is deployed. The 1px black stroke helps identify partially hidden dots and all of them are able to display their information when hovered over.
